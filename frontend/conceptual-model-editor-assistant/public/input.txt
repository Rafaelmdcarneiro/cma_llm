The domain covers various aspects of agricultural activities, focusing on the roles, tools, and processes involved in farming. A farmer is an individual engaged in agriculture, growing and harvesting crops, and is identified uniquely by a name that is used to refer to the farmer from various documentation, statistical reporting, etc.. Farmers own machinery, which reflects their capacity for mechanized farming, and conduct planting activities, crucial for management and accountability. They also farm on fields, undertaking not only crop cultivation but also soil preparation. The age of a farmer in years is used mainly for statistical and reporting purposes.

Planting represents the agricultural activity of planting crops in a specific field during a specific year, capturing the details of the process. Each planting activity results in a harvest, establishing a critical link for tracing agricultural output back to its origins, which aids in analyzing planting strategies, the impact of environmental conditions, and the overall productivity of agricultural practices. Planting activities are performed on specific fields where it occurs, indicating the location of agricultural operations and facilitating field-specific crop management, and involve particular crops, highlighting the variety of crops and their cultivation requirements during the planting process. The exact date or period of planting is also documented, essential for managing the agricultural cycle.

A harvest is the production obtained from crops, quantified and evaluated in terms of quantity and quality, representing the culmination of the agricultural cycle. The harvested crops are connected to the farmer responsible for the harvest and who evaluates the harvest's quality and quantity of the harvested crop, essential for market transactions and crop performance analysis. The specific date or period when the harvest is collected is crucial for maximizing yield and quality. High-quality harvests are crucial for market acceptance and consumer satisfaction. Therefore, the quality of the harvest, which may include factors like size, ripeness, nutritional value, and absence of pests or diseases. Moreover, the total quantity of the harvest, measured in kilograms, is crucial for determining the productivity and success of the crop.

Fields are areas of land used for growing crops that can but does not have to be surrounded by a fence and are described by several characteristics. The availability of irrigation systems and the type of irrigation used (e.g., drip, sprinkler, or flood) is vital for planning water usage and can impact crop selection and planting schedules based on the water needs of the crops. The geographical location of the field, which can include specific GPS coordinates or a general description (e.g., near a certain landmark), helps in locating the field for logistical purposes and for understanding its geographical and climatic context. The soil's pH and type affect crop health and dictate the types of amendments needed for optimal growth. In particular, pH indicates the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, which is crucial for managing soil health and fertility. Soil pH can significantly influence crop health and productivity, dictating the types of amendments needed to optimize growing conditions. The type of soil present in the field, such as loamy, sandy, clay, or silt affects water retention, nutrient availability, and the types of crops that can be successfully cultivated. The size of the field, which measures the total area of the field, typically in hectares, is fundamental for crop distribution planning, while the physical layout affects water drainage and machinery suitability. The topography of the field describes the physical layout of the land, including its flatness, slope, and elevation. It influences water drainage, erosion risk, and the suitability of various agricultural machinery.

Machinery encompasses mechanical tools and equipment crucial for tasks such as plowing, seeding, and harvesting. Tractors, as a subclass of machinery, are versatile and essential for multiple farming tasks, from soil preparation to crop maintenance. Planters are specifically designed to plant seeds efficiently, crucial for optimal crop distribution and growth. Harvesters is a specialized machinery that is used for harvesting. It includes machinery that combines tasks such as reaping, threshing, and winnowing, essential for harvesting, into a single operation. Sprayers are used for the precise application of liquids like pesticides, vital for protecting crops and enhancing growth. The year of manufacturing and model of the machinery indicate its age and potential modernity in technology, and influencing its functionality and suitability for specific tasks. It is important to know that a specific piece of machinery is used for planting. This links machinery like planters and some types of tractors that are specifically outfitted for or used during the planting of crops. Similarly, a piece of machinery can be used for harvesting. This is specific to machinery like combines, harvesters, and other equipment that is primarily utilized to collect and process crops at the end of their growing cycle. Finally, a piece of machinery, such as tractors equipped with specific attachments, are used to prepare the field for planting. This process might include plowing, tilling, and conditioning the soil to create an optimal planting environment.

Crops are plants cultivated in large amounts for profit or subsistence, including cereals, oil seeds, vegetables, and fruits. The cultivated variety of a crop is a critical classification. It is a plant grouping, within a single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank, defined by the reproducible expression of its distinguishing and other genetic characteristics. Vegetables and fruits are subcategories of crops, with vegetables including plants cultivated for their parts consumable by humans or other animals as food. and fruits cultivated for their seed-associated fleshy structures that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries.. Seed plants, another subclass, are grown for oil production from seeds, like sunflower and soybean, significant for both food and industrial uses. We also distinguish cereal as a plant cultivated for its edible grain.
